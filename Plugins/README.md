## Intermediate plugins

Libraries that are consumed by other plugins and not *nessasarily* intended for direct use inside of your project, but could be useful in some use cases.

- [SpecFlow.Actions.Configuration](./SpecFlow.Actions.Configuration)
  - Consumed within the other plugins to handle configuration.

- [SpecFlow.Actions.Appium](./SpecFlow.Actions.Appium/)
